# <ReadMe-Generator>

## Description

This project was created as my introduction to Node.JS. The purpose of this project was to learn how to call on server-side javascript using the 'node' function provided by node.js. Additionally, we also used the NPM library of modules.


## Installation

Note that this project requires both Node.js and NPM. Ensure you have both installed and available before continuing.


## Usage

In your console, type in node index.js and answer all prompts that show. Upon completion, you will find a generated ReadMe.MD file in your 'Generated files' folder.

## How to Contribute

Feel free to add additional functionality to this. There are a few additional potential items that can fill a read-me, such as 'Demo' or example images. But I did not want to tackle that just yet, as I need to figure out the functionality in directly adding these items with node.js
