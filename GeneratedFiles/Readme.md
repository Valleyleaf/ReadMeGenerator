## 💻Description
This project was created to test the features of Node.js and get myself familiarized with it's structure. This repo contains the files necessary to generate additional ReadMe files that contain a solid title, table of content and will then go through a few prompts to fill in items such as a description, installation, dependencies, usage and then share my contact info.

## 🚨Installation
Download the necessary files. Open the index.js file with your terminal and access it with the node command.

## ✅Dependancies
This requires node.js to be installed and uses NPM. So if you do not have NPM installed, you may need to add it.

## 🚀Usage
access the index file using the node command. Follow the instructions to generate your Readme.MD. Once generated, you will find it in the GeneratedFiles folder.
