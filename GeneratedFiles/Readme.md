## 💻Description
This project allows the user to create a professional ReadMe file using server-side code. By using this application, the user is able to procure ReadMe files in a simple and consistent manner.

## 🚨Installation
To install. Simply download the program and open it in your terminal.

## ✅Dependancies
Note that this program depends on Node.JS and the NPM module Inquirer. Both are needed for this program to run.

## 🚀Usage
To use, simply use the node command to call on the index.js file. Once called, you will be met with a series of prompts. These prompts can be answered with either inputs, or by checking in all applicable options.

## 💊Test
To test, I am tried to break the application using inputs that are not eligable within the inquirer function. Thankfully, this is automatically handled by the NPM library
